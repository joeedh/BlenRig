BlenRig is an Auto-rigging and skinning system that provides the user of feature film ready rig.

The curren version only supports Biped characters, but more presets will be supported in the near future

Usage
=====

You will find the rig in the Object Add panel, under the Armature Menu.

In the View3d tools panel you will find all the animation controls. In the Armature data panel you find all the riggin related tools.

Developers note:

As for this version, I do not recommend creating more than one BlenRig armature per blend file, as performance problems will arise in the newly created armature.
